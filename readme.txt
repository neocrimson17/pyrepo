This is just a demo of a web scraper in python 3.X.
If you have not installed beautiful soup QT5 then I recommend you do so. 
In addition, I've added QT5 for useful interface design. 
For now I will just play around with the widgets and buttons.  

open python in command prompt and install the following: 
	windows:
		pip install bs4
		pip install requests
	MAC OS: 
		pip3 install bs4
		pip3 install requests

Note: ignore the above comments if you've already installed Beautiful soup QT5.
The above use newegg.com as a demo but you can use a different website if you wish.  Although you will 
need to modify the codes accordingly since the elements in HTML are different for each website.
There's probably a way to dynamically set it up so that it can traverse each website dynamically
without us having to change the codes, but this is just a demo.  
I'm hoping to make a dynamic web scraper in the future that can crawl through any website and retrieve useful information

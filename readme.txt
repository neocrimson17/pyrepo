This is just a demo of a web scraper in python 3.X.
If you have not installed beautiful soup and requests on python 
then I recommend you do so.  

open python in command prompt and install the following: 
	windows:
		pip install bs4
		pip install requests
	MAC OS: 
		pip3 install bs4
		pip3 install requests

Note: ignore the above comments if you've already installed Beautiful soup and requests in python.
The above use newegg.com as a demo but you can use a different website if you wish.  Although you will 
need to modify the codes accordingly since the elements in HTML are different for each website.
There's probably a way to dynamically set it up so that it can traverse each website dynamically
without us having to change the codes, but this is just a demo.
